# Abstract Equality Stepper

This is a teaching aid to explain how Abstract Equality works according to the current version of the spec. Created primarily for use in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3vZSO4zpFs) and [this article](https://dev.to/emnudge/understanding-loose-equality-in-javascript-21c8).

This does not include a step for `document.all`, so don't even try it!
